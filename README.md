# wsbcompiler
## Brief introduction
This project is a small data gathering project to explore using the reddit api. It currently isn't doing any specific data collection, but it is setup to take console inputs or use a file called automation.txt to easily automate collection of data.

Initially my plan was to use this data for investments, which is why it is called wsb-compiler, which stands for Wallstreet bets complier. I decided against that strategy of investment, but this project is likely to be useful in future  to get general information on reddit.
